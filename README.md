# Odyssey: Mobile App for Solo Travelers
Problem solved:
Solo travel used to be viewed as unsafe or strange: but now it’s a major trend among travelers of all ages, who value freedom, flexibility, cultural immersion and personal growth. It has certain needs that general travel apps tend to sideline, which include enhanced safety features for individuals, connecting with like-minded travelers, flexible itineraries, and recommendations that emphasize authentic cultural immersion and hidden gems rather than the popular, cliched fare. A mobile app designed from a solo traveler’s point of view would bridge these gaps and prove valuable to the growing community of such travelers. This is where Odyssey comes into the picture: to provide resources that make the journey safe, meaningful and enjoyable.

Target audience:
This includes a diverse group of people wanting adventure, cultural immersion and independence while they travel. It’s not just limited to millennials and Gen-Z: it’s also geared towards older travelers, including the recently retired and “empty nesters”, who want to do more in their free time. There are a good number of solo travelers who are female and/or LGBTQ+, hoping for safe spaces and friendly faces on their journey. Whether the user is a nature enthusiast looking for trails or campsites in the most remote places, or a history buff seeking to understand a location’s past, Odyssey has them covered: recommending sites and activities for every interest. 

Monetization:
Odyssey uses a subscription model, with two basic tiers: free and premium. Free users have access to the basic features (ie: location check-in, community connections, saving favorite locations/creating wishlists, accessing maps, etc). Premium users (who can pay the subscription fee monthly or annually) unlock features such as advanced safety utilities (SOS alerts, live tracking), budget and expense tracking, downloading and accessing offline maps, exclusive deals/discounts/recommendations, etc. 

## Important instructions
Please run flutter upgrade and flutter pub upgrade before running the application.
